Personal blog / website using a template created by @zzzaim. I made little to no changes to the design— purely used this for ease of execution while I build out my page. credit: https://github.com/zzzaim/personal-minimalist-template

I was inspired to put together a quick personal website to show off my recently purchased NFT (soon to be plural)— but quickly pivoted to include more information, and possibly blog posts in the future. I decided I wanted to deploy my website on IPFS and pair with my ENS to fully decentralize the website. It is now live at the ipfs hash https://bafybeifmkww5mryppvf4ubg36jfuyo62skzmlj4t465es3cm3mc4gqjj3m.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io/, however I am working on connecting my ENS rachelrobbert.eth in order to access the website through rachelrobbert.eth.link. Soon!! I am not an engineer, and I certainly am not *technical*, but this has been a fun project for me! Looking forward to growing this site as I learn. :)
